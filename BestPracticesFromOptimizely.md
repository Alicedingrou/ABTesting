Define quantifiable success metrics - What is the final goal you are trying to optimize for? Don’t just start moving a bunch of levers around.
* This allows you to start identifying your bottlenecks
Could use Google analytics to see where traffic drops off, and optimize in that area
Explore before you refine - try and explore the whole space first to try and find what  works. Resist the temptation to assume your current site is already good and it just needs refinement. Your going to miss the best solution by just refining from where you start.
Great way to start is through usability testing - understanding where people are missing and failing. Try Navigation usability testing
Less is more, reduce choices
Words matter, focus on call to action.
If you want someone to do something, tell them to do it - “Free trial” vs “Try it free”
Fail Fast - when bad results are returned, pause the test, and figure out where the change is coming from: old vs new customers, etc
