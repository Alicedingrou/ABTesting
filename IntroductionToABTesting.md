# Introduction to AB Testing

> Greg Linden at Amazon created a prototype to show personalized recommendations based on items in the shopping cart [2]. You add an item, recommendations show up; add another item, different recommendations show up. Linden notes that while the prototype looked promising, a marketing senior vice-president was dead set against it, claiming it will distract people from checking out. Greg was forbidden to work on this any further. Nonetheless, Greg ran a controlled experiment, and the feature won by such a wide margin that not having it live was costing Amazon a noticeable chunk of change. With new urgency, shopping cart recommendations launched. Since then, multiple sites have copied cart recommendations.

There are many very good resources to learn AB Testing. This page provides some resources to understand the basics.

> Controlled experiments, also called randomized experiments and A/B tests, have had a profound influence on multiple fields, including medicine, agriculture, manufacturing, and advertising. Through randomization and proper design, experiments allow establishing causality scientifically, which is why they are the gold standard in drug tests. In software development, multiple techniques are used to define product requirements; controlled experiments provide a valuable way to assess the impact of new features on customer behavior. At Microsoft, we have built the capability for running controlled experiments on web sites and services, thus enabling a more scientific approach to evaluating ideas at different stages of the planning process. In our previous papers, we did not have good examples of controlled experiments at Microsoft; now we do! The humbling results we share bring to question whether a-priori prioritization is as good as most people believe it is. [3]
