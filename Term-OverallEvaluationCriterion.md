# Term - Overall Evaluation Criterion

Overall Evaluation Criterion (OEC) is referenced in many of the papers published by Kohavi et al. It originally comes from *[Design of Experiments Using The Taguchi Approach: 16 Steps to Product and Process Improvement](https://books.google.com/books?id=6zq3c3FaCq8C&q=Overall+Evaluation+Criterion#v=snippet&q=Overall%20Evaluation%20Criterion&f=false)*.

> The conept of an overall evaluation critieria occurs when there are more than one objective that a product or process is expected to satisfy. [1](Page 51)

In A/B experiments, we may need use more than one metric when evaluating the success of an experiment.

> The Overall Evaluation Criterion (OEC) [1] is a quantitative measure of the experimentâ€™s objective. In statistics this is often called the Response or Dependent Variable; other synonyms include Endpoint, Outcome, Evaluation metric, Performance metric, Key Performance Indicator (KPI), or Fitness Function. [2](Page 3)

> When a product or process under study is to satisfy more than one objective, performances of samples tested for each trial condition are evaluated by multiple criteria of evaluation. Such evaluations can be combined into a single quantity, the overall evaluation criterion (OEC), which is considered the result for the sample. But the evaluation of each individual criterion may have different units of measure, quality characteristics, and relative weighting. To combine the different criteria, they must first be normalized and weighted accordingly. [1](Page 53)

> **Define Your OEC**
> Optimize for the long term, not just clickthroughs
> * The sewing machine ad did not win on clickthrough, but it won on sales because they sold many pairs
> * Example long-term metrics
>     * Time on site (per time period, say week or month)
>     * Visit frequency
> * Phrased differently: optimize for customer lifetime value
> * We use the term OEC, or Overall Evaluation Criterion, to denote the long-term metric you really care about
> * Continue to evaluate many metrics to understand the specifics and for understanding why the OEC changed
